# What's Good

What's Good is a content-based social media app.



## About What's Good

As our world becomes increasingly driven by social media and, sadly, polarized along politico-cultural lines, it seems apparent that social media is increasingly co-opted as a tool to drive wedges between social niches. Our vision with What's Good was to carve out a positive space on the web by creating a social media platform for friendly interaction concentrated around shared tastes in books, games, movies, and music. Here, friends are invited to comment on their favorite (or not-so-favorite!) music, share a film they recently watched, rate the newest video games, write reviews on books both new and old, or preferrably, all of the above! We wanted to provide a forum for people to put a virtual representation of their favorite media on display, and we hope you enjoy it!
